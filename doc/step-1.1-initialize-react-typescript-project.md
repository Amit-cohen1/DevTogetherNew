# Step 1.1: Initialize React TypeScript Project

## Overview
This step covers the initialization of the DevTogether React TypeScript project, including folder structure setup, dependency installation, and basic configuration.

## Date Completed
May 31, 2025

## What Was Done

### 1. Created React App with TypeScript Template
```bash
npx create-react-app devtogether --template typescript
```
This created a new React application with TypeScript support and all necessary configurations.

### 2. Set Up Project Folder Structure
Created the following organized folder structure within the `src` directory:
- `components/` - Reusable UI components
- `contexts/` - React Context providers for global state
- `services/` - Service layer for API calls and business logic
- `pages/` - Page-level components for routing
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions and interfaces

### 3. Installed Core Dependencies
Installed the following packages as specified in the tech stack:
```json
{
  "react-router-dom": "^7.6.1",
  "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.49.8",
  "react-hook-form": "^7.56.4",
  "lucide-react": "^0.511.0"
}
```

### 4. Installed and Configured Tailwind CSS
- Installed Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer as dev dependencies
- Created `tailwind.config.js` with:
  - Custom color palette for DevTogether branding (primary and secondary colors)
  - Extended font family configuration
  - Content paths configured for all TypeScript/React files
- Created `postcss.config.js` for PostCSS processing
- Updated `src/index.css` with Tailwind directives

### 5. Environment Configuration
- Created `.env.example` file with Supabase configuration template:
  ```
  REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
  REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
  REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000
  ```
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude environment files

## Key Files Created/Modified
1. **Project Structure**: Created organized folder hierarchy
2. **tailwind.config.js**: Custom Tailwind configuration with DevTogether theme
3. **postcss.config.js**: PostCSS configuration for Tailwind
4. **src/index.css**: Replaced with Tailwind directives
5. **.env.example**: Environment variable template
6. **.gitignore**: Updated to exclude sensitive files

## Next Steps
- Configure Tailwind CSS custom theme further (Step 1.2)
- Set up Supabase backend (Step 1.3)
- Begin implementing authentication system (Phase 2)

## Notes
- All dependencies were successfully installed
- TypeScript is properly configured out of the box with Create React App
- The project is ready for development with hot reloading enabled
- The folder structure follows React best practices for scalability
