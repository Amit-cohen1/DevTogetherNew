# Step 1.3: Set Up Supabase Backend

## Overview
This step covers the complete setup of Supabase as the backend for DevTogether, including database schema design, Row Level Security (RLS) policies, storage configuration, and TypeScript integration.

## Date Completed
May 31, 2025

## What Was Done

### 1. Database Schema Design
Created comprehensive database schema with the following tables:

#### Users Table
- Extends Supabase auth.users
- Stores both developer and organization profiles
- Fields for role, bio, skills, social links
- Separate fields for organization-specific data

#### Projects Table
- Stores all project information
- Includes status tracking, difficulty levels
- Support for deadlines and duration estimates
- Technology stack as array field

#### Applications Table
- Manages developer applications to projects
- Includes status workflow (pending, accepted, rejected, withdrawn)
- Cover letter and portfolio links support
- Unique constraint to prevent duplicate applications

#### Messages Table
- Real-time messaging support
- Links messages to projects and senders
- Simple structure for efficient real-time updates

#### Project Members Table
- Tracks team composition
- Supports lead and member roles
- Manages project-user relationships

### 2. TypeScript Type Definitions
Created `src/types/database.types.ts` with:
- Complete type definitions for all tables
- Row, Insert, and Update types for each table
- Proper null handling and optional fields
- Type-safe database operations

### 3. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
Implemented comprehensive security policies:

#### User Policies
- Public profiles viewable by all
- Users can only update their own profile

#### Project Policies
- Open projects visible to everyone
- Only organizations can create/update/delete their projects
- Project members can view all project details

#### Application Policies
- Developers can view and manage their applications
- Organizations can view and update applications for their projects

#### Message Policies
- Only project members can view and send messages

#### Storage Policies
- Users can manage their own avatars
- Project members can access project files

### 4. Storage Bucket Configuration
Created two storage buckets:
- **avatars**: Public bucket for user profile images
- **project-files**: Private bucket for project-related files

### 5. Database Functions and Triggers
Implemented automation:
- `update_updated_at_column()`: Automatically updates timestamps
- `handle_new_user()`: Creates user profile on signup
- Triggers for maintaining data consistency

### 6. Supabase Client Configuration
Created `src/services/supabase.ts`:
- Configured typed Supabase client
- Enabled auto-refresh tokens
- Session persistence enabled
- Environment variable validation

### 7. Documentation
Created comprehensive setup guide:
- Step-by-step Supabase project setup
- SQL execution instructions
- Environment variable configuration
- Testing procedures

## Key Files Created/Modified
1. **src/types/database.types.ts**: Complete TypeScript type definitions
2. **src/services/supabase.ts**: Configured Supabase client
3. **src/services/supabase-schema.sql**: Database schema and RLS policies
4. **src/services/supabase-storage.sql**: Storage bucket configuration
5. **src/services/SUPABASE_SETUP.md**: Setup documentation

## Security Considerations
- All tables have RLS enabled by default
- Policies follow principle of least privilege
- User data isolation enforced at database level
- Storage access controlled by bucket policies

## Performance Optimizations
- Strategic indexes on foreign keys and commonly queried fields
- Efficient RLS policies using EXISTS queries
- Optimized for real-time subscriptions

## Next Steps
- Create actual Supabase project and run SQL scripts
- Begin Phase 2: Authentication System implementation
- Create auth context and hooks
- Build login/signup components

## Notes
- The schema is designed for scalability and future features
- RLS policies ensure data security without application-level checks
- Storage structure supports both public and private file needs
- Type safety ensures compile-time error catching
