Homepage provides comprehensive landing experience driving user registration and establishing DevTogether as legitimate platform. **READY FOR PRODUCTION** with cross-browser compatibility, performance optimization, SEO compliance, and accessibility features. Step 9.1 Complete - DevTogether Homepage Implementation ✅
- **2024-12-20**: **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Project State Filter Synchronization - Resolved issue where projects disappeared from projects page when status changed from "open" to "in_progress". **ROOT CAUSE**: Component filter state was not synchronized with role-based default filters - while search worked correctly with proper filters, UI checkboxes displayed incorrect state causing user confusion. **SOLUTION**: Updated useEffect in ProjectsPage to properly sync component `filters` state with calculated role-based defaults using `setFilters(finalFilters)` after filter determination. **IMPACT**: Developers now see both "open" and "in_progress" projects by default with UI checkboxes correctly reflecting actual search filters. **TECHNICAL**: Fixed state synchronization issue between search logic and UI display, ensuring single source of truth for filter state management. Projects remain visible throughout their lifecycle with consistent user experience. Documentation created: `project-state-filter-sync-fix.md`. **STATUS**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Filter state synchronized, UI matches search behavior, projects visible throughout status changes.
