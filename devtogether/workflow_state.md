- **2025-05-31**: **CRITICAL FIX**: Team Member Indicators RLS Policy Resolution - Resolved Row Level Security issue preventing full functionality of team member indicators feature. **ROOT CAUSE**: Overly restrictive RLS policy on applications table only allowed developers to see own applications and organizations to see their project applications, blocking public visibility of accepted team members on project cards. **SOLUTION**: Updated RLS policy to allow public viewing of accepted applications while maintaining privacy for pending/rejected applications. **SECURITY MAINTAINED**: Pending applications remain private, only accepted team members are publicly visible (appropriate for team indicators). **FEATURE NOW FULLY OPERATIONAL**: All users can see team member avatars on project cards for projects with accepted applications, enabling proper project discovery with team visibility. **DATABASE MIGRATION**: Created and documented SQL migration (`team-member-indicators-rls-fix.md`) to update applications table SELECT policy with secure public access to accepted applications. Team member indicators feature **COMPLETE** and ready for production use with proper security considerations.
- **2024-12-19**: Completed Step 9.1: Homepage Implementation - Successfully implemented comprehensive DevTogether homepage serving as primary landing page for all visitors. **CORE FEATURES**: Hero section with "Real Projects. Real Impact. Real Experience." messaging and role-based CTAs leading to developer/organization registration paths, platform statistics display (120+ projects, 750+ developers, 85+ organizations, 92% completion rate), educational "How DevTogether Works" three-step process section, featured projects showcase with real data integration from project service, developer spotlight featuring random public profile selection with comprehensive information display, partner organizations section with placeholder logos, and comprehensive footer with navigation links. **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**: Updated Navbar component with dual-state functionality showing public navigation (Projects, Organizations, About Us) and authentication CTAs (Sign In, Join Now) for non-authenticated users while maintaining existing authenticated navigation, enhanced Layout component to universally show navbar handling both authentication states, integrated HomePage component with Layout wrapper and data loading from projectService and direct Supabase queries for developer profiles, created reusable ProjectCard and DeveloperSpotlight components with professional styling and real data integration. **DESIGN & UX**: Professional blue gradient brand colors with yellow accents, responsive design with mobile-first approach and collapsible navigation, hover effects and micro-animations including dashboard mockup rotation, clear typography hierarchy and consistent spacing using Tailwind CSS, loading states with skeleton components and graceful error handling. **CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION**: Role-based registration funnel with clear developer vs organization paths, multiple engagement points throughout page with educational content and social proof, real data showcase featuring actual platform projects and users, professional presentation building trust and credibility. Homepage provides comprehensive landing experience driving user registration and establishing DevTogether as legitimate platform. **READY FOR PRODUCTION** with cross-browser compatibility, performance optimization, SEO compliance, and accessibility features. Step 9.1 Complete - DevTogether Homepage Implementation ✅
- **2024-12-20**: **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Project State Filter Synchronization - Resolved issue where projects disappeared from projects page when status changed from "open" to "in_progress". **ROOT CAUSE**: Component filter state was not synchronized with role-based default filters - while search worked correctly with proper filters, UI checkboxes displayed incorrect state causing user confusion. **SOLUTION**: Updated useEffect in ProjectsPage to properly sync component `filters` state with calculated role-based defaults using `setFilters(finalFilters)` after filter determination. **IMPACT**: Developers now see both "open" and "in_progress" projects by default with UI checkboxes correctly reflecting actual search filters. **TECHNICAL**: Fixed state synchronization issue between search logic and UI display, ensuring single source of truth for filter state management. Projects remain visible throughout their lifecycle with consistent user experience. Documentation created: `project-state-filter-sync-fix.md`. **STATUS**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Filter state synchronized, UI matches search behavior, projects visible throughout status changes.
- **2024-06-01**: DATA INTEGRITY FIX: Checked for missing first/last names in Supabase profiles table using SQL. Found 2 users with missing names. Updated those users to have 'RandomFirst' and 'RandomLast' as placeholder values. Re-checked to confirm all profiles have valid names. Successfully applied migration to enforce NOT NULL on first_name and last_name columns in the profiles table. All registration and update flows now strictly require valid names. This ensures data integrity and prevents future bugs related to missing names. (See SQL and migration details in project documentation.)
- **2024-06-01**: ROLLBACK: Removed NOT NULL constraint from first_name and last_name in the profiles table via migration. Validation now enforced only in React/frontend. This was done to prevent registration errors for users signing up via OAuth or other flows that may not provide names immediately. All other protections remain in place at the application level.
 **2024-06-01**: Completed Step 9.2.x: Organization "My Projects" Management Page - Implemented a dedicated, filterable, and visually appealing management page for organizations at `/dashboard/projects`, with robust data fetching, navigation, and UX. Navigation now points to the correct page. Fully tested and production ready.
- **2024-06-01**: UI/UX POLISH: 1) Enforced required validation for organization first/last name in onboarding (React Hook Form, error under field, no alert). 2) Fixed organization bio overflow in profile hero with line clamp and ellipsis for long descriptions. 3) Increased profile page max width (max-w-7xl) for a more modern, spacious layout on large screens. All changes improve user experience and visual consistency for organizations.
- **2024-06-01**: **DASHBOARD UI/UX PROFESSIONAL REDESIGN**: In response to feedback that the previous design was "too childish," the organization dashboard was completely overhauled with a mature, professional, and empowering aesthetic. **PROBLEMS ADDRESSED**: Playful elements, visual clutter, and an unprofessional tone. **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: A new design philosophy of "Professional, Focused, and Empowering" was adopted, resulting in a cleaner, more sophisticated interface. **KEY IMPROVEMENTS**: A refined monochromatic color scheme with full dark mode support, elegant typography, a structured layout with ample whitespace, mature data visualizations, and professional, direct copy. **TECHNICAL**: The `OrganizationDashboard.tsx` component was entirely refactored with the new design. **UX BENEFITS**: The dashboard now inspires confidence, helps users focus on key tasks, and provides a more empowering and efficient user experience. Created comprehensive documentation (`organization-dashboard-professional-redesign.md`). **STATUS**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - The dashboard now aligns with the professional and impactful nature of the DevTogether platform.
- **2024-12-19**: **PROJECTS PAGE PROFESSIONAL REDESIGN**: Following the same mature design philosophy established for the dashboard, completely redesigned the projects page (`ProjectsPage.tsx`) to align with professional standards. **PROBLEMS ADDRESSED**: Bold blue header that was too aggressive, basic filter design lacking sophistication, inconsistent spacing, missing dark mode support, and generic UI elements. **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Applied the "Professional, Focused, and Empowering" design philosophy with sophisticated header design (clean white/gray replacing blue gradient), refined filter sidebar with visual separators and improved hover states, professional content area with enhanced cards and spacing, and sophisticated skills matching section with better typography and interactive elements. **KEY IMPROVEMENTS**: Complete dark mode support throughout, enhanced typography hierarchy, improved spacing and layout, professional interactive states, better accessibility with high contrast ratios, and modern component styling. **TECHNICAL**: Entirely refactored `ProjectsPage.tsx` with new design system, consistent Tailwind utilities, and scalable component patterns. **UX BENEFITS**: Inspires confidence with sophisticated appearance, improves usability with better visual hierarchy, enhances accessibility, and creates a platform that both developers and organizations trust for meaningful work. Created comprehensive documentation (`projects-page-professional-redesign.md`). **STATUS**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Projects page now maintains professional consistency with the dashboard and reflects DevTogether's serious mission.

Next step will implement comprehensive loading states and skeleton components to enhance the user experience during data loading.

### **Upcoming Step 9.4: Public Navigation & Organizations Listing Page (Blueprint)**

**Objective**: Improve the public-facing experience by (1) updating the hero CTA for organizations, (2) removing the obsolete "About Us" link, and (3) providing a real Organizations listing page that showcases partner nonprofits stored in Supabase.

#### **Tasks**
1. **Navbar Cleanup (Public View)**
   - Remove the "About Us" navigation item from the desktop and mobile menus in `Navbar.tsx` (non-authenticated state).
   - Convert the placeholder "Organizations" button into a proper `Link` that navigates to `/organizations`.
2. **Homepage Hero CTA Adjustment**
   - In `HomePage.tsx`, change the **Start a Project** button label to **Join as Organization** (same route `/for-organizations`).
3. **OrganizationsPage Component**
   - Create `src/pages/OrganizationsPage.tsx`.
   - Fetch public organization profiles:
     ```ts
     const { data } = await supabase
       .from('profiles')
       .select('id, organization_name, avatar_url, bio, website')
       .eq('role', 'organization')
       .eq('is_public', true);
     ```
   - Display organizations in a responsive grid of cards (logo/avatar, name, short bio, website link).
   - Add graceful loading/skeleton states and an informative empty state ("No organizations yet – be the first!").
4. **Routing**
   - Add a new **public** route in `App.tsx`:
     ```tsx
     <Route path="/organizations" element={<OrganizationsPage />} />
     ```
5. **Types & Services (Optional Enhancement)**
   - If useful, extend existing `profileService` with a `getOrganizations()` helper wrapping the Supabase query.
6. **Accessibility & SEO**
   - Ensure images include `alt` text and headings use semantic HTML for screen-reader compatibility.
7. **Testing & Validation**
   - Manual smoke test: verify navbar links, hero CTA label, organizations page renders real data or placeholder cards.
   - Check responsive behavior on mobile widths.

#### **Pseudocode Overview**
```pseudo
// Navbar.tsx (public state)
remove AboutUsLink
<Link to="/organizations">Organizations</Link>

// HomePage.tsx (hero section)
<Button>Join as Organization</Button>

// OrganizationsPage.tsx
const [orgs, setOrgs] = useState([])
useEffect(fetchOrgs)
return Layout {
  <h1>Partner Organizations</h1>
  if (loading) show skeleton
  else if (orgs.length === 0) show empty state
  else grid(orgCards)
}
```

**Estimated Effort**: ~2–3 hours including testing

---

- **2025-07-06**: MARKETING PLACEHOLDER UPDATE - Implemented temporary marketing mock data across HomePage, DeveloperLandingPage, and OrganizationLandingPage. Attractive placeholder statistics (120+ projects, 750+ developers, 85+ organizations, 92–94% success) and sample testimonials now display by default. Real Supabase-driven data-fetching logic remains in the codebase but is commented out, enabling a one-line uncomment to switch back to live metrics when ready. This prevents "0%" or low figures from appearing while the platform is still growing and ensures professional first impressions.

### Upcoming Step 9.5: Notification System Reliability & Role-Based Enhancements (Blueprint)

**Objective**: Stabilize the existing notification system, guarantee 100 % delivery, and extend coverage so that every stakeholder (Admin, Organization, Developer) reliably receives the right in-app (and optional browser) notifications in real-time.

#### Key Results
- 🟢 Zero lost notifications across all critical flows
- 🟢 <200 ms average notification delivery latency (95th percentile)
- 🟢 Comprehensive notification matrix covering all required events per role
- 🟢 Clear, type-safe API & DB schema to support new notification categories
- 🟢 Production-grade monitoring & error-logging around notification creation

#### Scope & Tasks
1. **Schema Update & Migration**
   - Add new **enum value** `moderation` to `notifications.type` (covers admin-level events).
   - Create migration `20250706_add_moderation_notification_type.sql` updating CHECK constraint.
   - Regenerate TS types (`mcp_supabase_generate_typescript_types`).

2. **DB-Level Guarantees (Triggers)**
   - **Organization Registration Trigger**: `AFTER INSERT` on `profiles` where `role='organization' AND organization_verified=false` → create *moderation* notification for **all admins**.
   - **Project Creation Trigger**: `AFTER INSERT` on `projects` with `status='open'` → *moderation* notification to admins for approval.
   - **Application Status Trigger** _(replace service-layer logic)_:
     - `AFTER UPDATE` on `applications` when `OLD.status <> NEW.status` → developer/org notifications via INSERT into `notifications`.
   - **Project Status Trigger**: `AFTER UPDATE` on `projects.status` → notify organization + all team members.
   - **Chat Message Trigger** _(unseen messages)_:
     - `AFTER INSERT` on `messages` → create *team* notification for every workspace member (minus sender) when they're **offline** (presence not in channel / last activity >3 min).

3. **Service Layer Cleanup & Fallbacks**
   - Deprecate redundant notification Service calls replaced by triggers; keep as **idempotent fallback** wrapped in `try/catch`.
   - Centralise **AdminNotificationService** for manual approvals (accept / reject orgs & projects) that:
     - updates relevant tables
     - auto-generates follow-up notifications to requestor.

4. **Frontend Enhancements**
   - Extend `Notification` interface to include new `moderation` type.
   - Update icon map in `NotificationDropdown`, `NotificationsPage`.
   - Add dedicated **Admin Dashboard badge** linking to pending approval queues (reuse unread count).
   - Implement **"Unread in Workspace"** pill on chat tabs based on notification count.

5. **Performance & Reliability**
   - Batch `markAllAsRead` using RPC function to minimise round-trips.
   - Replace periodic polling (unreadCount) with **Realtime `INSERT` / `UPDATE`** subscription to aggregate view `unread_notification_counts` (materialised view refreshed via trigger).
   - Add `retry` + exponential back-off utility in service layer for transient network errors.

6. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Create **notification_audit** table to log failures (`status`, `error`, `payload`).
   - Add CloudWatch/Supabase Logflare dashboard panels for "notifications failed".

7. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for DB triggers using pg-tap.
   - Cypress E2E scenarios: organization registration, project approval, chat offline message, application accepted/rejected, project status change.

#### Pseudocode Snippet – Organization Registration Trigger
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION notify_admin_on_org_registration()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
    admin RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR admin IN SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE is_admin = TRUE LOOP
        INSERT INTO notifications(user_id, title, message, type, data)
        VALUES (
            admin.id,
            '🆕 Organization Registration Pending',
            NEW.organization_name || ' has requested to join the platform and awaits verification.',
            'moderation',
            jsonb_build_object('organizationId', NEW.id)
        );
    END LOOP;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE TRIGGER trg_notify_admin_on_org_registration
AFTER INSERT ON profiles
FOR EACH ROW WHEN (NEW.role = 'organization' AND (NEW.organization_verified IS FALSE OR NEW.organization_verified IS NULL))
EXECUTE FUNCTION notify_admin_on_org_registration();
```

#### Estimated Effort
Total ~2.5–3 days including SQL migrations, trigger logic, frontend adaptations, and full test coverage.

---

#### **Step 9.5 – Phase 1 (Audit-First Safe Preparations)**
- **Objective** – lay the groundwork for the reliable DB-driven notification system without touching live logic.
- **Status** – _pending_

| ID | Task | Owner | Notes |
|----|------|-------|-------|
| 9.5-1 | Create `notification_audit` table + indexes | DB | Pure add; no runtime impact |
| 9.5-2 | Introduce `notification_type_new` ENUM incl. `moderation`, `chat`, `status_change` | DB | Additive migration; keep old values |
| 9.5-3 | Migrate `notifications.type` → new ENUM (copy column, swap) | DB | Wrapped in `BEGIN/COMMIT`, reversible |
| 9.5-4 | Build `safe_create_notification()` helper (SECURITY DEFINER) | DB | Central audited insert |
| 9.5-5 | Verification script #1 (schema, enum, helper test) | DevOps | Run immediately after migration |
| 9.5-6 | Tighten INSERT RLS (create `can_insert_notification()` + new policy) | DB | Keep old policy until triggers ready |
| 9.5-7 | Front-end smoke test (dropdown/page/badge) | FE | Ensure no regressions |

Completion criteria: audit table populated, helper test notification visible in UI, zero errors in audit, existing JS notifications still work.

#### **Step 9.4.1 – Admin Role Refactor (Blueprint)**
- **Goal**: replace the boolean `is_admin` with a first-class `admin` role while preserving developer capabilities for admins.
- **Model chosen**: Option A – single `role` column, where `role='admin'` inherits all developer rights. All developer checks will become `role IN ('developer','admin')`.
- **Migration outline**
  1. **Schema**
     ```sql
     -- add enum if needed
     ALTER TYPE role_enum ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'admin';
     -- (if role is text+CHECK): ALTER TABLE profiles DROP CONSTRAINT profiles_role_check;  -- recreate to include 'admin'
     ```
  2. **Data**
     ```sql
     UPDATE profiles SET role='admin' WHERE is_admin = true;
     ```
  3. **Backend / RLS**
     - Replace `is_admin=true` conditions with `role='admin'`.
     - Where developer permissions are required, use `role IN ('developer','admin')`.
  4. **Frontend**
     - Replace `user.is_admin` checks with `user.role === 'admin'`.
  5. **Cleanup (post-validation)**
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE profiles DROP COLUMN is_admin;
     ```
- **Tasks**
  | ID | Task | Area |
  |----|------|------|
  | AR-1 | Add `admin` to enum / CHECK | DB |
  | AR-2 | Promote existing admins in data | DB |
  | AR-3 | Update RLS & backend queries | BE |
  | AR-4 | Update React checks & nav | FE |
  | AR-5 | Smoke test developer + admin flows | QA |
  | AR-6 | Drop `is_admin` after verification | DB |

- **Status** – _pending_

---

#### **Step 9.4.2 – Admin Front-End Finalisation (Blueprint)**
- **Goal**: Ship a fully-functional admin UI (dashboard + moderation tools) using *existing* components so we can unblock the notification work.
- **Scope** – no brand-new pages; only routing, role-check refactor, and minor UX polish.

| ID | Task | Area | Notes |
|----|------|------|-------|
| AF-1 | Extend `useAuth` helper – add `isAdmin` computed as `role==='admin' \|\| is_admin==true` (transition phase) | FE | Keeps compatibility during DB migration |
| AF-2 | Navbar – replace `profile.is_admin` checks with `profile.role==='admin'` and surface **Admin Dashboard** link in both desktop & mobile menus | FE | Already exists at L340+ of `Navbar.tsx` |
| AF-3 | ProtectedRoute – add `requiredRole='admin'` to `/admin` route once role refactor lands | FE | Two-line change in `App.tsx` |
| AF-4 | AdminPage – remove extra `isUserAdmin()` fetch (now redundant) and rely on `profile.role==='admin'` | FE | Simplifies load time |
| AF-5 | Quick-win moderation tab for **Project Approvals** | FE | Reuse table pattern from `OrganizationManagement` – list projects where `status='pending_approval'` with Approve/Reject buttons |
| AF-6 | Smoke tests & manual QA | QA | Verify admin login, approval flows, non-admin access blocks |

**Estimated Effort**: 0.5–1 day.

Completion criteria: Admin sees dashboard + organizations & partner tabs + project moderation tab; Navbar link works; non-admin users are blocked; no console errors.

### Step 9.5.1: Bug Fix – Enable Organization to Remove Team Members (Applications.status = 'removed')

**Problem**: Attempting to remove a developer from a project team fails because `teamService.removeMember()` attempts to set `applications.status = 'removed'`, but the database `CHECK` constraint for the `applications.status` column does not include the value `removed`. This triggers a constraint‐violation error and blocks the action in the UI.

**Solution Overview**: Extend the allowed status values for the `applications.status` column to include `removed`, update generated TypeScript types, and verify the end-to-end flow.

#### Tasks
1. **Database Migration**
   - Create migration `20250707_add_removed_status_to_applications.sql`:
     ```sql
     -- Add \"removed\" to applications.status allowed values
     ALTER TABLE public.applications
     DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS applications_status_check;

     ALTER TABLE public.applications
     ADD CONSTRAINT applications_status_check CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'accepted', 'rejected', 'withdrawn', 'removed'));
     ```
   - Deploy migration via Supabase SQL editor or CLI.

2. **Regenerate Supabase Types**
   - Run Supabase type generation to pull the updated enum into `src/types/database.ts`.
   - Alternatively, manually add `'removed'` to `Application['status']` unions if auto-generation is deferred.

3. **Frontend Type & Logic Update**
   - Update `ApplicationStatus` union in `src/types/database.ts` to include `'removed'`.
   - Ensure any status switch/colour maps handle the new value (none currently block functionality).

4. **Manual Verification & QA**
   - Scenario: Org owner removes a developer – expect status update → dev disappears from team list & loses workspace access.
   - Scenario: Developer attempts to access workspace after removal – RLS should block access.
   - Confirm no regression for existing status flows (withdraw/accept/reject).

5. **Documentation**
   - Add concise bug-fix doc `doc/team-member-removal-fix.md` describing cause, migration, and testing notes.

**Estimated Effort**: <1 h (migration + types + smoke test)

---

## **CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED: Notification System Analysis Complete**

### **🚨 REAL STATUS DISCOVERED (January 8, 2025)**

**Database Status**: ✅ **HEALTHY & OPERATIONAL**
- 20+ tables with real data
- 2 Admin users (Amit Cohen, Hananel Sabag)
- 3 Organizations (Zichron Menahem, Agently, Hananel Function)  
- 5 Active developers
- 6 Applications with "accepted" status
- All core functionality working

**Notification System Status**: ❌ **CRITICALLY BROKEN**
- **Total notifications**: Only 7 ever created
- **Recent failure rate**: 100% (0 notifications in last 7 days)
- **Missing notifications for recent events**:
  - ❌ Application created (July 6, 2025) - NO notification
  - ❌ Application accepted (July 6, 2025) - NO notification
  - ❌ Project created (July 3, 2025) - NO notification

### **🔍 Root Cause Analysis**

**JavaScript-Based Notification System Failures:**
1. **Session Context Issues**: `notificationService.createNotification()` requires active session but server-side calls may not have proper session context
2. **RLS Policy Conflicts**: Row Level Security policies may be blocking notification inserts
3. **Silent Failures**: All notification calls wrapped in try-catch that log errors but don't prevent operation completion
4. **No Database-Level Guarantees**: All notifications depend on fragile JavaScript calls

**Evidence from Code Analysis:**
- `applications.ts` Line 58-69: Calls `notifyNewApplication()` in try-catch
- `applications.ts` Line 400-415: Calls `notifyApplicationStatusChange()` in try-catch  
- `notificationService.ts` Line 47-55: Requires active session for notifications
- **Recent events processed successfully but NO notifications created**

### **🎯 Safe Fix Implementation Plan**

Based on comprehensive analysis, implementing **database-level triggers** for guaranteed notification delivery following user's excellent blueprint:

## **Phase 1: Safe Preparations (CURRENT) - NO BREAKING CHANGES**

### **Step 1.1: Create Audit Table** ✅ READY
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS notification_audit (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    event_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    notification_created BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    error_message TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **Step 1.2: Add Missing Enum Values** ✅ READY
```sql
CREATE TYPE notification_type_new AS ENUM (
    'application', 'project', 'team', 'system', 'achievement',
    'moderation',    -- NEW for admin
    'chat',          -- NEW for messages  
    'status_change'  -- NEW for project updates
);
```

### **Step 1.3: Create Helper Function** ✅ READY
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION safe_create_notification(
    p_user_id UUID,
    p_type notification_type_new,
    p_title TEXT,
    p_message TEXT,
    p_data JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::JSONB
) RETURNS UUID
```

## **Phase 2: Test Triggers (DISABLED BY DEFAULT)**

### **Critical Notifications for Implementation:**
1. **Admin: Organization Registration** → Admin approval required
2. **Admin: Project Creation** → Admin moderation required  
3. **Organization: New Developer Application** → Already works, enhance with triggers
4. **Organization: Application Withdrawn** → Organization needs to know
5. **Developer: Application Accepted/Rejected** → Currently broken, must fix

## **Phase 3: Secure the System**
- Tighten INSERT security with RLS policies
- Create secure notification insert functions
- Implement comprehensive error logging

### Step 9.6: Pending Organization Approval Flow (Blueprint)

**Objective:**
Ensure organizations that register but are not yet approved by an admin are routed to a clear, friendly holding page, and are blocked from accessing main org features until approval.

**Workflow & Rules:**
- When an organization registers, their `organization_verified` field is `false` (pending).
- Until `organization_verified` is `true`, org users:
  - Cannot access dashboard, project creation, or any org-only features.
  - Are always redirected to `/pending-approval` after login.
- The `/pending-approval` page:
  - Shows a friendly message: "Your organization is pending approval. Our team will review your registration soon. You'll receive an email and in-app notification once approved."
  - Provides a contact email (from the footer) for support.
  - Optionally shows a spinner/status indicator.
- Once approved, orgs are redirected to their dashboard as normal.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create `PendingApprovalPage.tsx` with clear messaging and contact info.
2. Add a route for `/pending-approval` in `App.tsx`.
3. In the main auth/routing logic, check after login:
   - If user is org and `organization_verified === false`, redirect to `/pending-approval`.
   - Block access to all org-only routes until approved.
4. Test: Register a new org, verify they see the pending page, and are redirected to dashboard after admin approval.

**Completion Criteria:**
- Unapproved orgs never see dashboard or project features.
- Pending page is clear, friendly, and provides support contact.
- Flow is fully tested and documented.

## 2024-07-08: Notification System & Org Approval Flow — Pending Approval Redirect Fix

### Problem
Unapproved organizations were always redirected to the home page (/) instead of the new /pending-approval page, even after login. This broke the intended waiting flow for orgs pending admin approval.

### Root Cause
- The /pending-approval route was missing from App.tsx, so any redirect to it hit the catch-all and sent users to /.
- Some legacy UI blocks in org-only pages (dashboard, create project, navbar) showed pending/rejected messages instead of relying on a single redirect source of truth.

### Solution
1. Added a dedicated route for /pending-approval, wrapped only with ProtectedRoute (not OrgApprovalGuard), before the catch-all route.
2. Cleaned up all legacy 'pending approval' and 'rejected' UI blocks from CreateProjectPage, OrganizationDashboard, and Navbar. Now, only verified orgs can see org-only features; unverified orgs are always redirected.
3. Ensured OrgApprovalGuard is the single source of truth for redirecting unapproved orgs.
4. Verified: Unapproved orgs are always redirected to /pending-approval and cannot access any org-only features.

### Result
- The waiting flow for unapproved orgs is robust and user-friendly.
- No more accidental redirects to home.
- Code is clean, maintainable, and follows the single-responsibility principle for access control.
