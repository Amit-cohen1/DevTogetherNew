-- ================================
-- 5. UPDATE NOTIFICATION TYPES IN ENUM (if needed)
-- ================================

-- Add new notification types to the existing enum if they don't exist
-- Note: This assumes the notification type column accepts these values
-- If using a strict enum, you might need to ALTER TYPE to add new values

-- ================================
-- 6. INDEXES FOR PERFORMANCE
-- ================================

-- Create indexes on new notification types for better query performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_notifications_meeting_type 
ON notifications(type) WHERE type IN ('meeting_scheduled', 'meeting_updated');

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_notifications_file_type 
ON notifications(type) WHERE type = 'file_uploaded';

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_notifications_repository_type 
ON notifications(type) WHERE type = 'repository_connected';

-- 7. COMMENTS FOR DOCUMENTATION

COMMENT ON FUNCTION notify_file_uploaded() IS 'Creates notifications when a file is uploaded to a project';
