# Status Manager Promotion Notification

## Overview
Enhanced the project workspace with a comprehensive notification system that informs developers when they've been promoted to Status Manager role. This feature provides clear communication about new responsibilities and permissions, improving user understanding and engagement with the promotion system.

## Implementation Details

### New Components

#### StatusManagerNotification Component (`src/components/workspace/StatusManagerNotification.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Display prominent notification when a developer is promoted to status manager
- **Features**:
  - Eye-catching gradient design with shield icon
  - Detailed explanation of status manager role and responsibilities
  - List of new permissions with clear visual indicators
  - Helpful tip about accessing status management features
  - Dismissible with persistent state using localStorage
  - Responsive design for all screen sizes

#### Key Features:
1. **Visual Design**:
   - Blue gradient background with professional appearance
   - Shield icon representing management authority
   - Check circle indicating successful promotion
   - Clean typography with clear hierarchy

2. **Content Structure**:
   - Congratulatory header with clear role designation
   - Explanation of promotion significance
   - Detailed permissions list with bullet points
   - Navigation tip for immediate action

3. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Dismissible via X button in top-right corner
   - Persistent dismissal state using localStorage
   - Project-specific dismissal (won't show again for same project)
   - Smooth fade-out animation on dismissal

4. **Permissions Explained**:
   - Update project status and progress
   - Set project milestones and deadlines
   - Add progress notes and updates
   - Help coordinate team activities

### Workspace Integration

#### ProjectWorkspace Component Updates (`src/components/workspace/ProjectWorkspace.tsx`)
- **Notification Placement**: Added to overview section for maximum visibility
- **User Detection**: Enhanced logic to detect status manager developers
- **State Management**: Integrated with existing workspace state
- **Import Additions**: Added Shield icon from Lucide React

#### Logic Enhancements:
```typescript
// Check if current user is a status manager (but not the owner)
const userIsStatusManager = user && userRole === 'developer' && !isOwner &&
    teamMembers.some(member =>
        member.user.id === user.id && member.status_manager === true
    );
```

#### Sidebar Role Display:
- **Your Role Section**: Added sidebar section showing user's current role
- **Status Manager Badge**: Visual indicator with shield icon
- **Permission Reminder**: Small note about additional permissions
- **Conditional Display**: Only shows for developers, includes status manager info when applicable

### User Experience Enhancements

#### Notification Behavior:
1. **Trigger Conditions**:
   - User must be a developer (not organization owner)
   - User must have `status_manager = true` in applications table
   - Notification must not have been previously dismissed for this project

2. **Persistence Logic**:
   - Uses localStorage with project-specific keys
   - Key format: `status-manager-notification-dismissed-{projectId}`
   - Dismissal state survives browser sessions
   - Different projects show notification independently

3. **Visual Hierarchy**:
   - Placed prominently at top of overview section
   - Uses attention-grabbing but professional design
   - Clear call-to-action directing to Status tab
   - Maintains consistent design language with rest of workspace

#### Sidebar Enhancements:
1. **Role Awareness**:
   - "Your Role" section for developers
   - Regular "Developer" badge for all developers
   - Additional "Status Manager" badge for promoted developers
   - Shield icon reinforcing management authority

2. **Permission Context**:
   - Brief reminder of additional permissions
   - Consistent visual design with main notification
   - Persistent visibility for ongoing awareness

### Technical Implementation

#### Component Architecture:
```typescript
interface StatusManagerNotificationProps {
    userIsStatusManager: boolean;
    projectId?: string;
    onDismiss?: () => void;
}
```

#### Storage Management:
- **localStorage Integration**: Persistent dismissal tracking
- **Project Isolation**: Each project tracks dismissal independently
- **Key Generation**: Unique keys based on project ID
- **State Synchronization**: useEffect hooks for loading stored state

#### Performance Considerations:
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only renders when notification should be shown
- **Lightweight Storage**: Minimal localStorage usage
- **Efficient Updates**: State changes trigger re-renders only when necessary
- **Memory Management**: No memory leaks from event listeners

### Integration Points

#### Existing System Compatibility:
1. **Team Management System**: Builds on existing promotion functionality
2. **Workspace Service**: Uses existing team member data structure
3. **Authentication Context**: Integrates with current user state
4. **Project Context**: Works with existing project data flow

#### Future Enhancement Opportunities:
1. **Email Notifications**: Could integrate with notification service
2. **Achievement System**: Could trigger achievement unlocks
3. **Analytics Tracking**: Could track notification interaction rates
4. **Role History**: Could show promotion history and timeline

### Benefits

#### For Promoted Developers:
- **Clear Communication**: Immediate understanding of new role
- **Permission Awareness**: Detailed explanation of new capabilities
- **Guidance**: Direct navigation to relevant features
- **Recognition**: Professional acknowledgment of promotion

#### For Organizations:
- **Reduced Support**: Self-explanatory permission system
- **Better Adoption**: Users understand and use new permissions
