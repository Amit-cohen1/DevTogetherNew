# DevTogether Notifications - "View All" Footer Visibility Fix

## Problem
The "View all notifications" link at the bottom of the notification dropdown was disappearing/hidden, despite notifications being present in the dropdown.

## Root Cause
The notification dropdown had layout issues that were causing the footer to be cut off or hidden:

1. **No Flexbox Layout**: The dropdown container wasn't using flexbox, causing content to overflow
2. **Max Height Conflicts**: The `max-h-80` on the notifications list was conflicting with the overall `max-h-96` container
3. **Footer Position**: The footer could get pushed outside the viewport or be covered by overflow content
4. **No Layout Constraints**: Header and footer weren't constrained to always be visible

## Solution
Enhanced the dropdown layout with proper flexbox structure to ensure the footer always remains visible:

### **1. Container Layout**
```tsx
className="absolute right-0 top-full mt-2 w-96 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg border border-gray-200 z-50 max-h-96 overflow-hidden flex flex-col"
```
- **Added `flex flex-col`**: Proper flexbox layout for vertical stacking
- **Maintained `max-h-96`**: Overall height constraint remains
- **Maintained `overflow-hidden`**: Clean dropdown appearance

### **2. Header Constraints**
```tsx
<div className="p-4 border-b border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 flex-shrink-0">
```
- **Added `flex-shrink-0`**: Header always maintains its size
- **Always visible**: Header cannot be hidden by overflow

### **3. Content Area**
```tsx
<div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto">
```
- **Changed from `max-h-80`** to `flex-1`: Takes available space between header and footer
- **Maintained `overflow-y-auto`**: Scrollable when content exceeds available space
- **Responsive height**: Adapts to actual available space

### **4. Footer Constraints**
```tsx
<div className="p-3 border-t border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 flex-shrink-0">
```
- **Added `flex-shrink-0`**: Footer always maintains its size and visibility
- **Always visible**: Footer cannot be pushed out of view
- **Clear documentation**: "Always show if notifications exist" comment

## Files Changed
1. **src/components/notifications/NotificationDropdown.tsx**:
   - Enhanced container with flexbox layout
   - Added flex constraints to header and footer
   - Improved content area sizing
   - Added clarifying comments
