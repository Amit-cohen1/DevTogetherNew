# Admin Dashboard Mobile Optimization

## Overview
Complete mobile optimization of the Admin Dashboard and all its components to ensure proper functionality and user experience on mobile devices.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Dangerous System Monitoring Removal**
- **Problem**: System Monitoring tab was causing site crashes due to resource-intensive database polling
- **Solution**: Completely removed the NotificationMonitoring component and System Monitoring tab
- **Benefits**: Eliminated crash risk and improved overall admin dashboard stability

### 2. **Mobile Navigation Issues**
- **Problem**: Tab navigation was not mobile-responsive, causing horizontal scrolling issues
- **Solution**: 
  - Added horizontal scrolling container with `overflow-x-auto`
  - Implemented mobile-specific spacing (`space-x-2 sm:space-x-8`)
  - Added `whitespace-nowrap` to prevent text wrapping
  - Reduced padding on mobile (`px-3 sm:px-1`)

### 3. **Statistics Cards Layout**
- **Problem**: Cards were cramped on mobile screens
- **Solution**:
  - Changed grid from `grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4` to `grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4`
  - Reduced padding (`p-3 sm:p-4`)
  - Adjusted font sizes (`text-lg sm:text-2xl` for numbers, `text-xs sm:text-sm` for labels)
  - Smaller icons on mobile (`h-4 w-4 sm:h-5 sm:w-5`)
