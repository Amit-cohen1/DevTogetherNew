# Discover Projects Light Theme Fix

## Overview
Fixed display issues where project cards appeared dark for users with dark browser themes, and improved the search button styling.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Project Cards Dark Theme Issue** ✅
- **Problem**: ProjectCard component had dark mode classes that made cards appear dark for users with dark browser themes
- **Solution**: Removed all `dark:` classes from ProjectCard.tsx component
- **Result**: All project cards now consistently display in light theme regardless of user's browser/system theme

### 2. **Search Button Too Light** ✅  
- **Problem**: Search button in hero section was barely visible (`bg-white/20`)
- **Solution**: Changed to solid blue background (`bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700`)
- **Result**: Search button now clearly visible and properly styled

## Files Modified

### ProjectCard.tsx
- Removed all dark mode classes (`dark:bg-gray-800`, `dark:text-white`, etc.)
- Ensured consistent light theme styling across all card elements
- Maintained professional design and functionality

### ProjectsPage.tsx  
- Updated search button from transparent white to solid blue
- Improved visibility and contrast in hero section

// Before (ProjectCard)
className="group relative bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700..."

// After (ProjectCard)
