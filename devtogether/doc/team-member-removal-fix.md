# Workspace Access Bug â€“ Developer Blocked by OrgApprovalGuard (June 2024)

## Problem
After introducing the OrgApprovalGuard and route protection for unapproved organizations, developers who were accepted to a project could no longer access the project workspace. This was a regression: previously, accepted developers could always access their project workspace.

## Root Cause
The `/workspace/:projectId` route in `App.tsx` was wrapped with:
```tsx
<ProtectedRoute requiredRole="organization">
  <OrgApprovalGuard>
    <ProjectWorkspace />
  </OrgApprovalGuard>
</ProtectedRoute>
```
This meant only users with `role === 'organization'` could access the workspace. Developers (`role === 'developer'`) were blocked by the `ProtectedRoute` before reaching the workspace or the org approval guard.

## Solution
The route was updated to:
```tsx
<ProtectedRoute>
  <OrgApprovalGuard>
    <ProjectWorkspace />
  </OrgApprovalGuard>
</ProtectedRoute>
```
This allows both developers and organizations to access the workspace, while still blocking unverified orgs via the guard. Now, accepted developers can access their project workspace as intended.

## Status
- Bug fixed
- Workspace access restored for developers
- Org approval guard still blocks unverified orgs as intended
