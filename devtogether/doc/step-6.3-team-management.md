# Step 6.3: Team Management

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive team management features for project workspaces, allowing organization owners to manage team members and providing team activity feeds for all members. This completes Phase 6: Team Collaboration with full workspace, messaging, and management capabilities.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Team Management Service (`src/services/teamService.ts`)
Created a comprehensive service layer for team operations:

**Core Interfaces:**
- `TeamMember`: Team member data structure with role and status
- `TeamActivity`: Activity tracking with metadata and user information
- `TeamInvitation`: Invitation system for future email integration
- `TeamStats`: Team analytics and engagement metrics

**Key Methods:**
- `getTeamMembers()`: Retrieves team composition including organization owners and accepted developers
- `removeMember()`: Allows organization owners to remove team members
- `leaveProject()`: Enables developers to leave projects
- `getTeamActivities()`: Fetches team activity feed with user details
- `logActivity()`: Records team events and activities
- `getTeamStats()`: Calculates team engagement metrics
- `sendInvitation()`: Placeholder for future email invitation system

**Database Integration:**
- Uses existing applications table for team membership tracking
- Updates application status to 'removed' or 'withdrawn' for member changes
- Queries projects and users tables for complete team information

### 2. Team Management Components

#### TeamManagement (`src/components/workspace/team/TeamManagement.tsx`)
Main team management interface providing:

**Features:**
- Team statistics dashboard with engagement metrics
- Complete team member list with role-based display
- Member removal functionality for organization owners
- Leave project option for developers
- Invite member modal integration
- Real-time team data updates

**UI Components:**
- Team stats cards (total members, recent activity, messages, engagement)
- Member cards with avatars, roles, and join dates
- Action buttons with permission-based visibility
- Loading states and error handling

#### TeamActivityFeed (`src/components/workspace/team/TeamActivityFeed.tsx`)
Activity tracking component featuring:

**Activity Types:**
- Member joined/left/removed events
- Project updates and milestones
- Message activity tracking
- Custom activity metadata display

**Features:**
- Real-time activity updates
- Intelligent time formatting (relative and absolute)
- Activity type icons and color coding
- Activity metadata display
- Empty state handling

#### InviteMemberModal (`src/components/workspace/team/InviteMemberModal.tsx`)
Future-ready invitation system:

**Current Implementation:**
- Email validation and form handling
- Coming soon notification for users
- Professional modal interface
- Error handling and loading states

**Future Features:**
- Email invitation system integration
- Role assignment options
- Invitation expiry management
- Acceptance/decline tracking

### 3. Database Schema Updates

#### Team Activities Table (`migrations/20250531_create_team_activities_table.sql`)
**Table Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE team_activities (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    project_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    activity_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (activity_type IN (...)),
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    metadata JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Activity Types:**
- `member_joined`: New team member addition
- `member_left`: Developer voluntarily leaving
- `member_removed`: Organization owner removing member
- `project_updated`: Project information changes
- `message_sent`: Team communication activity
- `milestone_reached`: Project progress markers

**Security & Performance:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for team member access
- Optimized indexes for project_id, user_id, created_at, and activity_type
- Supabase Realtime integration for live updates

### 4. Integration Points
