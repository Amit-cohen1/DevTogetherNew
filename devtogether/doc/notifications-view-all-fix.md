# DevTogether Notifications - "View All" Navigation Fix

## Problem
The "View all notifications" link in the notification dropdown was not working because the route wasn't connected to the NotificationsPage component.

## Root Cause
- ✅ **NotificationDropdown component** had correct "View all notifications" link pointing to `/notifications`
- ✅ **NotificationsPage component** was implemented with comprehensive functionality
- ❌ **App.tsx routing** was missing the `/notifications` route definition

## Solution
Added the missing route to `src/App.tsx`:

```tsx
{/* Notifications Route */}
<Route
  path="/notifications"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <NotificationsPage />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>
```

## Files Changed
1. **src/App.tsx**:
   - Added import for `NotificationsPage`
   - Added protected route for `/notifications` path

## What Now Works
✅ **"View all notifications" link** in dropdown navigates to full notifications page  
✅ **Direct URL navigation** to `/notifications` works properly  
✅ **Protected route** ensures only authenticated users can access  
✅ **NotificationsPage features** are all accessible:
   - Comprehensive notification statistics dashboard
   - Advanced filtering (search, type, status)
   - Mark as read/delete actions
   - Professional UI with loading states

## Testing
- Click the "View all notifications" link in the notification dropdown
- Should navigate to `/notifications` showing the full NotificationsPage
- All notification management features should work correctly
- Direct URL access to `/notifications` should work when logged in

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Notifications "View All" navigation now works correctly
