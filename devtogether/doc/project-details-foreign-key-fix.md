# Project Details Page Foreign Key Fix - DevTogether

## üö® Critical Issue: Project Details Page Not Loading

### Problem Description
The project details page was failing to load due to an incorrect foreign key relationship in the `project_members` table query.

**Error Pattern:**
```
Could not find a relationship between 'project_members' and 'profiles' in the schema cache

GET .../projects?select=*%2Corganization%3Aprofiles%21projects_organization_id_fkey%28*%29%2Cproject_members%28*%2Cuser%3Aprofiles%21projects_organization_id_fkey%28*%29%29%2Capplications%28*%2Cdeveloper%3Aprofiles%21applications_developer_id_fkey%28*%29%29&id=eq.89558ca3-b488-4d77-9b58-27671ec8ab74 400 (Bad Request)
```

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `projects.ts` service where the `getProject()` function was using the wrong foreign key relationship for the `project_members` table.

**Database Schema:**
- `project_members.user_id` ‚Üí `profiles.id` (correct relationship)
- `project_members.project_id` ‚Üí `projects.id`

**Application Code Issue:**
The query was incorrectly using the organization foreign key instead of the user foreign key:

```typescript
// INCORRECT (was using organization foreign key)
project_members(
  *,
  user:profiles!projects_organization_id_fkey(*)
)

// CORRECT (should use project_members user foreign key)
project_members(
  *,
  user:profiles!project_members_user_id_fkey(*)
)
```

### Technical Solution

**File**: `src/services/projects.ts`
**Function**: `getProject()`
**Line**: ~79

**Before (BROKEN):**
```typescript
project_members(
  *,
  user:profiles!projects_organization_id_fkey(*)
)
```

**After (FIXED):**
```typescript
project_members(
  *,
  user:profiles!project_members_user_id_fkey(*)
)
```

### Database Schema Verification

Confirmed the correct foreign key relationships:

```sql
-- project_members table structure
project_members:
  - id (uuid, primary key)
  - project_id (uuid, foreign key ‚Üí projects.id)
  - user_id (uuid, foreign key ‚Üí profiles.id)
  - role (text)
  - joined_at (timestamp)

-- Foreign key constraints
project_members_project_id_fkey: project_members.project_id ‚Üí projects.id
project_members_user_id_fkey: project_members.user_id ‚Üí profiles.id
```

### Impact Resolution

**Before Fix:**
- ‚ùå Project details page completely broken with 400 errors
- ‚ùå Unable to view project information, team members, or applications
- ‚ùå Project workspace access failing
- ‚ùå Team management features inaccessible

**After Fix:**
- ‚úÖ Project details page loads correctly
- ‚úÖ Team members displayed properly (when they exist)
- ‚úÖ Applications list working
- ‚úÖ Project workspace accessible
- ‚úÖ Organization information displayed correctly

### Additional Notes

1. **Empty Project Members**: Many projects may not have entries in the `project_members` table initially, which is normal for newly created projects.

2. **Application Check Errors**: There may be secondary 406 errors related to application checks, which could be due to RLS policies but don't affect the main project details functionality.

3. **Related Tables**: This fix ensures consistency with other foreign key relationships that were previously corrected in the system.

### Files Modified
- `src/services/projects.ts` - Fixed project_members foreign key relationship

### Verification Query
```sql
-- Test project details with correct foreign keys
SELECT 
    p.*,
    org.organization_name,
    org.avatar_url
FROM projects p
LEFT JOIN profiles org ON p.organization_id = org.id
WHERE p.id = 'project-id-here';
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Project details page foreign key relationship corrected

**Critical Issue Priority**: **P1 - Feature Breaking** ‚Üí **Resolved**

The project details page now loads correctly with proper team member and application information display.
