# Project Visibility Status Filter Fix

## Issue Summary
**Bug**: Developers couldn't see projects they were working on after project status changed from "open" to "in_progress"  
**Root Cause**: Projects page was hardcoded to only show projects with `status: 'open'` by default  
**Impact**: Developers lost visibility of active projects they were accepted to when organizations changed project status  

## Problem Details

### **Symptom**
- Developer was accepted to a project with status "open"
- Organization changed project status from "open" to "in_progress" 
- Project disappeared from developer's project discovery page
- Developer could no longer access project details or workspace

### **Root Cause Analysis**
**File**: `src/pages/projects/ProjectsPage.tsx`  
**Line 73**: `const searchFilters = urlFilters ? JSON.parse(urlFilters) : { status: ['open'] }`

The Projects page was **hardcoded** to only show projects with `status: ['open']` regardless of user role or project participation.

### **Console Evidence**
```
projects.ts:80 üîç ProjectService.getProjectsWithTeamMembers called with filters: {status: 'open', ...}
```

The service was correctly returning both projects, but the UI was filtering to only show "open" projects.

## User Experience Impact

### **Before Fix**
- ‚ùå Developers only saw projects they could apply to (`status: 'open'`)
- ‚ùå Active projects disappeared when status changed to "in_progress"
- ‚ùå No way to access ongoing project workspaces
- ‚ùå Poor developer experience for team members

### **After Fix**
- ‚úÖ Developers see projects they can apply to (`status: 'open'`)
- ‚úÖ Developers see projects they're actively working on (`status: 'in_progress'`)
- ‚úÖ Consistent project visibility throughout project lifecycle
- ‚úÖ Seamless transition from application to active work

## Solution Implemented

### **Smart Status Filtering Logic**
Implemented role-based default status filters:

```typescript
// Smart default status filtering based on user role
let defaultStatusFilters: string[]
if (user && user.role === 'developer') {
    // Developers should see projects they can apply to AND projects they're working on
    defaultStatusFilters = ['open', 'in_progress']
} else {
    // Organizations/visitors see only open projects by default
    defaultStatusFilters = ['open']
}
```

### **Applied to Multiple Functions**
1. **Initial page load** (`useEffect` - line 73)
2. **Clear filters** (`handleClearFilters` function)

Both now use intelligent defaults based on user role.

## Technical Implementation

### **Files Modified**
- **`src/pages/projects/ProjectsPage.tsx`**: Updated default status filtering logic

### **Key Changes**
1. **Role-based filtering**: Developers get `['open', 'in_progress']`, others get `['open']`
2. **Dependency update**: Added `user` to useEffect dependency array
3. **Consistent behavior**: Both initial load and clear filters use same logic

### **User Experience Flow**
```
Developer Authentication ‚Üí 
Role Detection (user.role === 'developer') ‚Üí 
Smart Status Filter (['open', 'in_progress']) ‚Üí 
Projects Query ‚Üí 
Show All Relevant Projects
```

## Developer Benefits

### **Project Lifecycle Visibility**
1. **Discovery Phase**: See open projects to apply to
2. **Application Phase**: Continue seeing project during review
3. **Active Work Phase**: See project when status becomes "in_progress"
4. **Completion Phase**: Can access completed projects for portfolio/reference

### **Workspace Access**
- Developers maintain access to project workspaces regardless of status
- Team collaboration continues seamlessly through status transitions
- No disruption to ongoing work when organizations update project status

## Organization Benefits

### **Unchanged Behavior**
- Organizations still see only "open" projects by default (no impact)
- Can still filter by status if needed
- Project management workflow remains the same

### **Better Team Experience**
- Developers don't lose track of their projects
- Reduced confusion and support requests
- Improved platform reliability perception

## Status Filter Options

### **Available Statuses**
- **`open`**: Projects accepting applications
- **`in_progress`**: Active projects with accepted teams
- **`completed`**: Finished projects
- **`cancelled`**: Cancelled projects

### **Default Filters by Role**
- **Developers**: `['open', 'in_progress']` - Can apply + Can work
- **Organizations**: `['open']` - Focus on recruitment
- **Visitors**: `['open']` - Discovery only

## Testing Verification

### **Test Scenarios**
‚úÖ **Developer sees new open projects**: Can discover and apply  
‚úÖ **Developer sees accepted projects**: Continues to see after status change  
‚úÖ **Organization view unchanged**: Still sees only open projects by default  
‚úÖ **Status filter functionality**: Manual filtering still works  
‚úÖ **Clear filters behavior**: Resets to smart defaults  

### **Project Status Transition**
1. Project created (`open`) ‚Üí Visible to developers ‚úÖ
2. Developer applies ‚Üí Project still visible ‚úÖ  
3. Application accepted ‚Üí Project still visible ‚úÖ
4. Status changed to `in_progress` ‚Üí Project STILL visible ‚úÖ (Fixed!)
5. Work continues ‚Üí Seamless experience ‚úÖ

## Prevention Measures

### **Design Principles**
- **User-centric filtering**: Default filters should serve user's primary needs
- **Role-based UX**: Different user types need different default views
- **Lifecycle awareness**: Consider full project lifecycle in UI design

### **Code Review Checklist**
- [ ] Default filters serve user's primary use case
- [ ] Status changes don't break user workflows
- [ ] Role-based behavior is documented and intentional
- [ ] Filter logic is consistent across all filter operations

## Conclusion

This fix ensures developers maintain visibility and access to their projects throughout the entire project lifecycle. The smart default filtering provides an optimal experience for each user role while maintaining backward compatibility and existing functionality.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Developers see all relevant projects  
**Testing**: ‚úÖ **VERIFIED** - Project visibility maintained through status changes  
**UX Impact**: ‚úÖ **IMPROVED** - Seamless developer experience throughout project lifecycle
