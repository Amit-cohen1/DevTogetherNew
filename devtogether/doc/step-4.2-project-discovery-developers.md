### Search and Filtering Logic

The filtering system uses a comprehensive `useMemo` hook that combines multiple filter criteria:

```typescript
const filteredProjects = useMemo(() => {
  let filtered = projects

  // Text search across multiple fields
  if (searchTerm) {
    const searchLower = searchTerm.toLowerCase()
    filtered = filtered.filter(project => 
      project.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
      project.description.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
      project.requirements.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
      project.technology_stack.some(tech => tech.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower)) ||
      project.organization?.organization_name?.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower)
    )
  }

  // Technology stack filtering (OR logic)
  if (filters.technology_stack.length > 0) {
    filtered = filtered.filter(project =>
      filters.technology_stack.some(tech =>
        project.technology_stack.includes(tech)
      )
    )
  }

  // Additional filters...
  // Sorting logic...

  return filtered
}, [projects, searchTerm, filters, sortBy, sortOrder])
```
