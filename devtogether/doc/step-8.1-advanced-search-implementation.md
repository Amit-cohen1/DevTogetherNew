  async getSearchHistory(userId: string, limit: number = 10): Promise<SearchHistory[]>
  async deleteSearchHistory(userId: string, searchHistoryId?: string)
  
  // Popular searches tracking
  async updatePopularSearches(searchTerm: string)
  async getPopularSearches(limit: number = 10): Promise<PopularSearch[]>
  
  // Search analytics

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Improvement

**Important Design Decision:** After initial implementation, we identified that having both a `/projects` page (with basic search) and a separate `/search` page (with advanced search) created duplicate functionality and potential user confusion.

### Consolidation Approach

We **consolidated all search functionality into the main `/projects` page**, making it the single comprehensive project discovery interface:

#### Changes Made:
1. **Enhanced Projects Page:** Replaced basic search with advanced search components
2. **Removed Redundant Page:** Deleted the separate `/search` page entirely
3. **Updated Navigation:** Changed "Browse Projects" to "Discover Projects" in navbar
4. **Unified Experience:** Single entry point for all project discovery needs

#### Benefits:
- **Eliminates Confusion:** Users don't need to choose between "browse" and "search"
- **Better UX:** All discovery features in one place
- **Simpler Navigation:** Cleaner navbar without redundant options
- **Consistent Experience:** Unified interface for all project discovery

#### Result:
The `/projects` page now serves as the complete project discovery hub with:
- Full-text search with auto-complete
- Advanced filtering options
- Multiple view modes
- Search history and analytics
- URL-based bookmarking
- Professional search interface

This architectural improvement provides a better user experience while maintaining all advanced search capabilities.

## üìù Next Steps

With Step 8.1 complete, the next development phase is **Step 8.2: Recommendation System**, which will implement:

1. **Recommendation Algorithm:** Smart project recommendations based on user profiles
2. **"Projects for You" Section:** Personalized project suggestions on dashboard
3. **Similar Projects Feature:** Related project discovery on project detail pages
4. **Trending Projects:** Popular and trending project recommendations

The advanced search implementation provides the foundation for sophisticated project discovery and recommendation features in the DevTogether platform.
